# Automatic coding of parents' shared reading practice
- Shared reading is coded using the PEER coding scheme
  - Prompt: Ask questions using CROWD (completion, recall, open-end, wh, distancing)
  - Evaluate: Praise or correct a child's utterance
  - Expand: Elaborate on a child's utterance
  - Repeat: Request a child to say the correct answer

## Part 1: Transcribe the audio file
1. Transcribe an audio recording into an excel file (see [here](https://github.com/smy1/swlab/blob/main/script/audio2xlsx.ipynb)).
2. Convert the excel file into a csv file.

## Part 2: Code the transcript
1. Download the PEER coding scheme [here](./peek.docx).
2. Get a unique GEMINI API key. Create a .env file and store the key in it like this: `GEMINI_API_KEY = the-API-key`
3. Download the Python [script](./drei.py) (modified slightly from [Prof Tsai's original script](https://github.com/peculab/autogen_project/blob/main/DRai/DRai.py)).
4. Open an editor (e.g., [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) and type the following:
```python
python -m venv venv #create a virtual environment the first time
.\venv\Scripts\activate #activate venv
python .\drei.py mc51.csv ##code the file "mc51"
deactivate #deactivate venv
```
## Part 3: Fancy output
1. Prof Tsai's original script stores the coded transcript as a csv file.

__Wishlist__
- Purchase a more advanced model?
- Transform the scores into a 7-point Likert scale.
- Create a simple (yet appealing) html page that shows the summary of PEER scores.
- Create a plot that displays how the parent fared in relation to other parents with a similar-aged child.
- Provide some advice/encouragement as to which DR strategy the parent can improve on.
- Print this summary as a pdf to be sent to the parent (if they wish to keep a copy).
