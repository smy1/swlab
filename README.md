# Video editing
This repo contains codes that I wrote to automatise video-editing tasks for projects that I lead as a postdoc in CBDL-Lab (09.2023 - 12.2025). See the links below to read more about what the scripts do.

## List of scripts
1. [Edit videos](https://github.com/smy1/swlab/blob/main/python/) (using Python)
2. Transcribe audio files (opens another [repository](https://github.com/smy1/auto-peer/blob/main/transcribe-audio/audio2xlsx.ipynb))
3. Code parents' shared reading practice (opens another [repository](https://github.com/smy1/auto-peer/blob/main/))
